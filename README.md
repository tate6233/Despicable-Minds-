Longmont Fire Dept project report-
Lift for old/obese people who have fallen and can't get up

Background/Client Info:
  In the past 25 years medical calls to the fire department have increased by almost four fold (National Fire Protection Association). Included in these medical calls are old and/or obese people who have fallen and can't get up without assistance. When firefighters answer these calls they rely solely on their strength to lift the fallen person, putting unnecessary strain on their backs. Our goal is to create something portable and capable of assisting firefighters with the lifitng motion when helping someone who's fallen. Our client is Micah Holmes from the Longmont Fire Department.

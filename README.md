Longmont Fire Department Project Report- The Fally"
=================
Background/Client Info:
-----------------------
  In the past 25 years medical calls to the fire department have increased by almost four fold [http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2012/07/firefighters-dont-fight-fires.html](National Fire Protection Association). Included in these medical calls are old and/or obese people who have fallen and can't get up without assistance. When firefighters answer these calls they rely solely on their strength to lift the fallen person, putting unnecessary strain on their backs. Our goal is to create something portable and capable of assisting firefighters with the lifitng motion when helping someone who's fallen. Our client is Micah Holmes from the Longmont Fire Department.

Design Requirements:
---------------------
*Dimensions: same aize as EMS board or smaller ( 72" x 16" x1.75" )
*Portable 
*Lightweight 
*Set-up time: 5- 10 minutes (easy to use)
*Budget limit: $375.00 or $75.00 per group member 
*Must be able to fully statnd up the victim 

Design Alternatives (Brainstorming):
--------------------------------------
  Once we decided on helping firemen pick up the elderly or obese, our group started brainstorming different types of lifts. Our goal was to build a machine that is portable and quick to set up. This machine will make it easier for firemen to lift these people up without straining their legs and backs. So, our group came up with five different design ideas. We looked at all the desings together and looked at the pros and cons of each. We also took into account how costly each design would be. This is important because we are on a $375 budget for the project. After some thought and discussion, we narrowed it down to two designs. Our first design is based on a dolley system where the fallen person is rolled into a sack and pulled upward through a series of pulleys by the firemen. Our second design is based off a machine used on construction sites to lower and higher workers through man holes. Our design consists of four extendable legs for stability and a sling for the person to position themselves on. We emailed Micah, our client, and asked for his opinion on which design he prefers.

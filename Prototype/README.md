Prototype
=================

Resources/Features: 
  We were able to find all of the resources and materials necessary for our prototype at the resource yard here in Boulder. We found five recycled plastic lumber boards perfect for the legs and frame. This material is nice because it is very cheap and easy to work with. We struggled slightly trying to find something to use for a pully system, however we found what appears to be four wheels off of an old piece of rolling furnature. These will attatch to the frame, and a nylon rope we found will run along the wheels and attach to a sling or pouch. The resource yard also had brackets and screws which are perfect for putting our prototype together.

Construction Proccess: 
  The first thing we constructed for our prototype was the frame for the top. We took one of our pieces of plastic lumber and cut it into four even pieces, all a half a foot long. We then cut the end of each piece at 45 degrees so they would fit together to from a square. The frame was very sturdy after screwing in the brackets on the corners.

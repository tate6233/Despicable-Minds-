Prototype
=================

Resources/Features: 
-------------------------
   We were able to find all of the resources and materials needed for our prototype at the resource yard located here in Boulder. We found five recycled plastic lumber boards perfect for the legs and frame. This material is nice because it is very cheap and easy to work with. We struggled slightly trying to find something to use for a pully system, however we came across what appears to be four wheels off of an old piece of rolling furnature. These will attatch to the frame, and a nylon rope we found will run along the wheels and attach to a sling or pouch. We will constrcut this pouch out of an old t-shirt. The resource yard also had brackets and screws which are perfect for holding our prototype together.

Construction Proccess:
-------------------------
>**Shape**: The first thing we constructed for our prototype was the frame for the top. We took one of our pieces of plastic lumber and cut it into four even pieces, all half a foot long. We then cut the end of each piece at 45 degrees so they would fit together to from a square. The frame was very sturdy after screwing in the brackets on the corners. After this We cut the bottoms of the four remaining legs so that when standing they were angled 20 degrees to the vertical (70 degrees from the horizontal). We connected the legs to each corner of the frame with screws, giving us the shape of our quad pod.

>**Pully System**: First we drilled holes down in the top of the frame. The pegs on the furniture wheels fit snugly into the holes, and the wheels faced upwards. When laid over the wheels as a pulley, the rope did not stay in the center of the wheel.  We fixed this by gluing two lines on the wheel with a hot glue gun creating a track that the rope follows. The rope was attached to the sling and then brought up through the system of pulleys. We used tape on legs to hold the rope instead of cleats, but cleats will be on the final.

Fallbacks:
---------------------------
We noticed one fallback of our project while creating our prototype. When struggling with getting the legs to stay standing at the correct angle, we realized how hard it would be to get the legs to rotate out on the corners and lock while on hinges because locking hinges that are compatible with our design were either hard to find or outside of our budget. A solution that we will use to attempt to fix this problem is having a cable or rope run around the outside of the legs at the bottom so they don't slide and will be secure. That way we can just use regular hinges and not a special locking hinge.

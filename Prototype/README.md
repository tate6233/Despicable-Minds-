Prototype
=================

Resources/Features: 
-------------------------
   We were able to find all of the resources and materials needed for our prototype at the resource yard located here in Boulder. We found five recycled plastic lumber boards perfect for the legs and frame. This material is nice because it is very cheap and easy to work with. We struggled slightly trying to find something to use for a pully system, however we came across what appears to be four wheels off of an old piece of rolling furnature. These will attatch to the frame, and a nylon rope we found will run along the wheels and attach to a sling or pouch. We will constrcut this pouch out of an old t-shirt. The resource yard also had brackets and screws which are perfect for holding our prototype together.

Construction Proccess:
-------------------------
>**Shape**: The first thing we constructed for our prototype was the frame for the top. We took one of our pieces of plastic lumber and cut it into four even pieces, all half a foot long. We then cut the end of each piece at 45 degrees so they would fit together to from a square. The frame was very sturdy after screwing in the brackets on the corners. After this We cut the bottoms of the four remaining legs so that when standing they were angled 20 degrees to the vertical (70 degrees from the horizontal). We connected the legs to each corner of the frame with screws, giving us the shape of our quad pod.
